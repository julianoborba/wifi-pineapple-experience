# Universal Wifi pineapple hardware cloner v4

The Pineapple NANO and TETRA are excellent security hardware but in 2020 they reached their end of life.<br>
So to give a new life to this platform on more modern hardware I developed these scripts to port it to different routers.<br>

Sometime between 2019 and 2020 we started using the private beta of this project which my friends called "Pineapple Termidor".<br>
So at the time of remaking this project I decided to rescue the original name from oblivion ðŸ¤£


## About this project

This project is the result of everything I've experienced from 2018 to 2022 to successfully clone the NANO and TETRA in any hardware.<br>

For this I've develop:
* The lists of files to copy and also the script to copy them.
* A script to patch the file system to work on any hardware.
* Completely updated [panel](https://github.com/xchwarze/wifi-pineapple-panel) with fixes and improvements.
* Completely updated [packages repository](https://github.com/xchwarze/wifi-pineapple-community/tree/main/packages).
* New [module repository](https://github.com/xchwarze/wifi-pineapple-community/tree/main/modules).
* New modules: [PMKIDAttack](https://github.com/xchwarze/wifi-pineapple-community/tree/main/modules/src/PMKIDAttack) and [Terminal](https://github.com/xchwarze/wifi-pineapple-community/tree/main/modules/src/Terminal)

## Builds

You can find the complete steps to build this project in [this document](build.md). I also added several important notes in this matter.
<br>


## Supported devices

There are 211 devices supported by the project. You can see the full [list here](devices.md).
<br>

Also I made a second repo for [downloads](https://github.com/xchwarze/wifi-pineapple-cloner-builds) where you can find the firmwares already made for the most common devices of the Supported devices list.
<br>


## Install steps

1. Install OpenWrt version 19.07.7 on your router
<br>

2. Use SCP to upload the image in your device
```bash
scp gl-ar750s-universal-sysupgrade.bin root@192.168.1.1:/tmp 
root@192.168.1.1's password: 
gl-ar750s-universal-sysupgrade.bin                                                                        100%   13MB   2.2MB/s   00:05 
```
<br>

3. Once the image is uploaded, execute sysupgrade command to update firmware
```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.1
sysupgrade -n -F /tmp/gl-ar750s-universal-sysupgrade.bin
```
Now wait few minutes until the device install the new firmware
<br>

4. Enter to pineapple panel and enjoy! `http://172.16.42.1:1471/`
<br>
In the download repo you can find some debugging tips if you have problems.
The project manages to create hardware that works just like the original, so if you follow the steps and read the documentation you should have no problems.
<br>

5. Once installed, the project has a tool that helps us to do several things.
For example you can use it to change the panel theme with this command:
```bash
service wpc-tools theme_install
```
<br>
